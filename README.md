Welcome to ninjaPoll!
===================


This is a poll app made with ruby on rails by the Ninja Team.

----------


Getting you started
-------------

This is a classic rails project. Therefor, you can initialize it like any other:

```
$ cd [wherever you cloned this]
$ rails db:migrate # will apply migrations
$ rails db:seed # will seed some data in the database
$ rails s # will start a dev server so you can explore the app right away
```

If you run ```$ rails db:seed```, it will create a poll with some answers so you don't have to brother create your own.
Also, it will create an admin so you can edit polls and poll questions:
- login : admin@admin.com
- password: fooBar

You're all set up, go create some polls !
